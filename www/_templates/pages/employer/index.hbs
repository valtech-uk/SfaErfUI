<p>There are six steps to taking on an apprentice:</p>

<ol class="step-by-step-coloured">
	<li>
		<h3 class="heading-medium">Choose an apprenticeship standard</h3>
		<p>A standard is a list of the skills that apprentices will have once they’ve completed their apprenticeships.</p>
		<p>Every job role has a different standard.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3 class="heading-medium">Apply for funding</h3>
		<p>The government will partly fund your apprenticeship.</p> 
		<p>The amount of funding depends on the apprentice’s age and the size of your business, among other things.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3 class="heading-medium">Find a training provider</h3>
		<p>Training providers are colleges or other organisations that carry out your apprentice’s training.</p> 
		<p>Some providers train apprentices at a campus, others will travel to you.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3 class="heading-medium">Recruit your apprentice</h3>
		<p>Apprentices can be someone you already know, or someone new.</p> 
		<p>Depending on factors like which standard you choose and where you’re based, your apprentice could join you within a few weeks.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3 class="heading-medium">Start the apprenticeship</h3>
		<p>As an employer you’ll have to agree to some simple terms and conditions.</p> 
		<p>They include asking your apprentice to sign an agreement, and meeting national minimum wage laws.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3 class="heading-medium">Complete the apprenticeship</h3>
		<p>Apprentices must be assessed during their programme.</p> 
		<p>Your training provider will find an assessment organisation for you, or you can look for one yourself.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
