			<h2 class="heading-large">What are your responsibilities as an employer?</h2>

            <p>When you employ an apprentice, you’re agreeing to provide:</p>
            <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>meaningful work</li>
                <li>a salary</li>
                <li>time to train</li>
                <li>on-the-job training</li>
                <li>an employment contract</li>
                <li>an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-agreement-template" rel="external">apprenticeship agreement</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">a statement of commitment</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your apprentice could be new to workplaces. You may need to show them what’s expected of employees.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-medium">Pay and conditions</h3>

            <p>You must pay your apprentice at least £2.73 an hour. Most employers choose to pay more than this.</p>
            <p>If they’re 19 or older and have completed the first year of their apprenticeship, they’re entitled to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates" rel="external">national minimum wage</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-medium">Training</h3>

            <p>Apprentices need paid time off for training.</p>
            <p>This includes any extra time for English and maths study, or support if they have disabilities or learning difficulties.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-medium">Hours</h3>

            <p>Apprentices usually spend:</p>
            <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>30 hours a week working</li>
                <li>one day a week training</li>
            </ul>

            <p>They must work for at least 16 hours a week, and be able to complete their apprenticeships inside their contracted hours.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-medium">Ending the apprenticeship early</h3>

            <p>Your apprentice is an employee with a contract. You can't usually make them redundant just because you can't afford to pay them, for example.</p>
            <p>If you want to end the apprenticeship early for another reason you should get legal advice.</p>
